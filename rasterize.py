    """Save a figure with raster and vector components
    This function lets you specify which objects to rasterize at the export
    stage, rather than within each plotting call. Rasterizing certain
    components of a complex figure can significantly reduce file size.
    Inputs
    ------
    fname : str
        Output filename with extension
    rasterize_list : list (or object)
        List of objects to rasterize (or a single object to rasterize)
    fig : matplotlib figure object
        Defaults to current figure
    dpi : int
        Resolution (dots per inch) for rasterizing
    savefig_kw : dict
        Extra keywords to pass to matplotlib.pyplot.savefig
    If rasterize_list is not specified, then all contour, pcolor, and
    collects objects (e.g., ``scatter, fill_between`` etc) will be
    rasterized
    Note: does not work correctly with round=True in Basemap
    Example
    -------
    Rasterize the contour, pcolor, and scatter plots, but not the line
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> from numpy.random import random
    >>> X, Y, Z = random((9, 9)), random((9, 9)), random((9, 9))
    >>> fig, ((ax1, ax2), (ax3, ax4)) = plt.subplots(ncols=2, nrows=2)
    >>> cax1 = ax1.contourf(Z)
    >>> cax2 = ax2.scatter(X, Y, s=Z)
    >>> cax3 = ax3.pcolormesh(Z)
    >>> cax4 = ax4.plot(Z[:, 0])
    >>> rasterize_list = [cax1, cax2, cax3]
    >>> rasterize_and_save('out.svg', rasterize_list, fig=fig, dpi=300)
