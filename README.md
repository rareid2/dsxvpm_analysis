# dsxvpm_analysis

This is all the code that I used for VPM-DSX conjuction analysis -- you can find code to compute doppler shifts, time delays, LEO ray 'spots', 
superposed epoch analysis, plotting wavenormal angle distributions, tracing magnetic field lines, and ray trace from VLF transmitters

If you're interested in any of these, give me a heads up!
